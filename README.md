# ContourDetectionUsingOpenCV
Using contour detection, we can detect the borders of objects, and localize them easily in an image. It is often the first step for many interesting applications, such as image-foreground extraction, simple-image segmentation, detection and recognition[1].  

Code for ContourDetection using openCV and resized the image to dimension(width*height) i.e. as per requirements and save directly to any given directory...!
